            <h3>What Is Biodiversity?</h3>
            <p>Biodiversity is the variety and variability of life on Earth. To put it simply, it is the sum of every single different species of creatures on this planet. Every single creature has its own quirks and distinctive features.</p>

            <p class=class1><b><i>This is a picture of the Dodo Bird. It is a flightless bird, with many curious qualities. However, it went extinct due to excessive hunting.</i></b></p>
            <h3>What Is Causing Loss Of Biodiversity?</h3>
            <p>Biodiversity loss is caused by five primary drivers: habitat loss, invasive species, overexploitation (extreme hunting and fishing pressure), pollution, climate change associated with global warming. In each case, human beings and their activities play direct roles.</p>

            <p class=class1><b><i>This is a mind map of the reasons for biodiversity loss, split up into sub-points.</i></b></p>
            <h3>Why Is Biodiversity Important To Us?</h3>
            <p>Biodiversity is important to us as by losing any single species to extinction, we are effectively unable to interact with or even enjoy the existance of that species. The specific traits and quirks associated with those species will also be lost to history. To summarise, the more species that go extinct, the less unique we become.</p>
